# The Project
Eluminis noticed the rise of IoT powered homes. They also noticed that people used different systems (Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri) to power their homes. These users sometimes even combined home systems for some odd reason.
Eluminis decided that they should implement a system where users can easily control their homes from a web-interface and eventually an app.
They wanted to focus on basic functionality. Think lighting, sound volumes, and _other basic things_.
They built a library that wrapped around the most famous home systems. This can be found in the `com.elepy.eluminis.external` package. And now they want to build the web-interface and eventual app around it.


## Notes
- Make use of the over-engineered mock library 'EluminisAssistant' to change lighting/sound levels.
- Do not change anything in the mock library.
- This repo will contain 2 branches. A before(master) and a potential solution(development)
